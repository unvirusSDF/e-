## notes :
 - please note that this is a silly project just for fun and im aim to train my ncurses skills

## downloading : 
  if you want to use it for your own fun you can download it, however take note that even if it's a c++ project your compiler could not work for it since i used (circle)[https://www.circle-lang.org/site/index.html], another argument to use it is that a make file is already written for this compiler and could speed up your build

### functionalities
  - working menus and text box
  - gambling (no reward just pop a window at a random location)
