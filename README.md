## notes :
 - please note that this is a silly project just for fun and im aim to train my ncurses skills

## downloading : 
  if you want to use it for your own fun you can download it, however take note that even if it's a c++ project your compiler could not work for it since i used (circle)[https://www.circle-lang.org/site/index.html], another argument to use it is that a make file is already written for this compiler and could speed up your build

  ### Makefile info
   - all build all
   - c link all .o
   - install copy the executable in /bin
   - clean remove all .o
   - so if you just want to install it enter `make all install`

## functionalities
  - working menus and text box
  - gambling (no reward just pop a window at a random location)

## name origin:
 i had no idea, toto was already taken by all the other executables. it was in c++, the e came from the 50 decimal places on e which were in front of me when i made the Makefile
